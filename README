Some notes on using this code:

- before use, modify base_path in config.py to point at your working directory.

- in your working directory, you should create the following sub-folders: 
-- lcs/
-- plot_outputs/
-- tables/
-- ss_finders/ (optional; see plot.plot_four if you want to include finder images in this plot)

- you'll also need the target pixel files (TPFs) you want to analyze somewhere on your computer

- c4_script.py is the wrapper around the other codes. It will run a single star or a list of stars through this code.

- If you want to run a set of stars, use c4_tpfs_box.csv or c4_tpfs_extra_box.csv as an example. You can also just use a list of TPFs, with the full path to them under the header "filename".
